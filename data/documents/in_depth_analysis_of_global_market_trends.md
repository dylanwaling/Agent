Investing in analytics capabilities unlocks faster iteration and clearer accountability. Sensitivity tests show the plan remains viable under conservative demand scenarios. The data also reveals a long tail of low‑frequency, high‑value buyers.
Digital touchpoints now account for the majority of first‑time conversions. Benchmarking peers shows room to streamline SG&A without harming growth velocity. The proposed KPI set emphasizes retention, contribution margin, and cash conversion cycle. Early pilots validate the value proposition and clarify the onboarding friction points. Governance should formalize decision rights around pricing, promotions, and channel conflicts.
